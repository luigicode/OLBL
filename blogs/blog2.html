            <h1 class="m-heading">The Angelic Hymn of the Men's Choir</h1>
           <p>
            I was hearing mass and heard something nice from the choir... 
            voices from the men!
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            I managed to contact the <b>Men's Choir</b> after mass,
            one of which is <b>Renzo Bunye</b> (extreme left). 			
            A friendly man in his early 20s, 
            and has a seasoned singing experience. 
            Renzo is one of the Rookies in the choir.
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            Renzo told me that he wanted to stay in service to the church.
            Since he was "too old" for the youth, so he decided to join the Men's Choir.
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            Usually, there are 10-15 members from the group. 
            Every <b>5:30 pm</b>, these adults from all around Merville sing in perfect unison. Like a group of beautiful swans skimming in the lake. 
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            Although Renzo may be one of the youngest in the choir,
            the usual age ranges to 40-70, but of course, all of them look very young to me.
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            Even though it's  an all-men group, surprisingly, it is managed by <b>Tita Joyce Frias</b>.
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            I'm sure that Renzo and the Men's Choir enjoy what they do, whether it be singing together, or chatting with their fellow men.
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            If you ever consider joining the Men's Choir, please do so. 
            They are passionate about what they do and are very friendly to one another.
            </p>
    <br/>
            <p>
            I enjoyed listening to the Men's Choir. Their voices lightened up the mood of the church. 
            When you hear mass, feel free to listen to them sing. 
            Believe me, it's exceedingly bliss!
            </p>
