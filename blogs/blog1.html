            <h1 class="m-heading">The Hardworking People of OLBL office</h1>
            <p>
            I went to church and visited the parish office of <b>OLBL</b>.<br> 
            There I met 2 friendly secretaries, Ate Ronaly and Kuya Michael <br/> (Ate Neda wasn't there). <br/>
            Although they were very busy, they were willing to assist me. <br/> They even told me about what they do in the office <br/>(their roles and responsibilities). 
            </p>
              <br/>
            <p>
              Their duties in the office vary with small things, handling of files relating to the <b>OLBL</b> church or its members, managing the bulletin board,<br/> to bigger events like fundraising or children's mass.
            </p>
             <br/>
            <p>
              They also help people with personal things such as marriage documents, baptismal appointments, funeral services,<br/> or simple things like the schedule of mass or directions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              The parish office plays an <b>important</b> role in the church.<br/> Without them, we probably wouldn't know where the restroom is.<br/>I do suggest you visit them when you have the time.<br/> They will greet you with a friendly face and help you in any way they can.
